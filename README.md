# Learning Software Design Best Practices

These are my projects for _Software Design_ course. We practiced Test Driven Development (TDD) and learned many design principles and patterns with hands-on experience.

This course was taught by awesome _Venkat Subramaniam_. For more information and learn from him, check out his [website](https://www.agilelearner.com/).
